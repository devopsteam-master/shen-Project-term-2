Here’s a checklist of Kubernetes objects you’ll need for each Helm chart, divided by the component. This includes the necessary objects for HA (for Redis and PostgreSQL as StatefulSets) and basic Kubernetes deployment objects:

### 1. **Vote Service (vote)**
   - **Deployment** (for the Vote app container)
   - **Service** (for exposing the Vote service to the cluster)
   - **Ingress** (optional, for external access)
   - **ConfigMap** (if you need to manage configuration for the Vote service)
   - **Secrets** (for sensitive data like API keys, passwords)
   - **HorizontalPodAutoscaler** (optional, if you want autoscaling)

### 2. **Result Service (result)**
   - **Deployment** (for the Result app container)
   - **Service** (for exposing the Result service to the cluster)
   - **Ingress** (optional, for external access)
   - **ConfigMap** (if you need to manage configuration for the Result service)
   - **Secrets** (for sensitive data like API keys, passwords)
   - **HorizontalPodAutoscaler** (optional, if you want autoscaling)

### 3. **Worker Service (worker)**
   - **Deployment** (for the Worker app container)
   - **Service** (if the Worker needs to be exposed to other components)
   - **ConfigMap** (for configuration management)
   - **Secrets** (for sensitive information)
   - **HorizontalPodAutoscaler** (optional, for autoscaling)

### 4. **Redis (StatefulSet with HA)**
   - **StatefulSet** (for deploying Redis with HA)
   - **Service** (for the internal Redis service)
   - **ConfigMap** (if Redis configuration needs customization)
   - **Secrets** (for storing Redis password securely)
   - **PersistentVolumeClaim** (for Redis data persistence)
   - **Headless Service** (for StatefulSet discovery)

### 5. **PostgreSQL (StatefulSet with HA)**
   - **StatefulSet** (for deploying PostgreSQL with HA)
   - **Service** (for internal access to PostgreSQL)
   - **ConfigMap** (for PostgreSQL configuration, if needed)
   - **Secrets** (for database credentials)
   - **PersistentVolumeClaim** (for PostgreSQL data persistence)
   - **Headless Service** (for StatefulSet discovery)

### Shared Items for All Components:
   - **Helm Chart** (for deploying each of the components)
   - **Namespace** (optional, but you can deploy all components in a dedicated namespace)
   - **Resource Requests & Limits** (CPU/Memory settings for each container)
   - **Liveness & Readiness Probes** (to ensure app health checks)
   - **NetworkPolicy** (if needed, for controlling communication between services)

This checklist includes the primary Kubernetes objects for deploying each component via Helm charts in your cluster. Let me know if you need any further details on specific objects!
